## 1.7 Challenge Problem

To solidify your understanding of the concepts discussed so far, let's tackle a practical challenge problem. This exercise will give you hands-on experience with a traditional statistical method and help you identify its limitations, setting the stage for more advanced techniques introduced in later chapters.

### Task

Your task is to use a traditional statistical method, specifically linear regression, to predict housing prices. By working through this challenge, you will gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of linear regression and understand why more sophisticated machine learning techniques might be necessary.

### Objective

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Handle missing values in the dataset.
   - Select relevant features that are likely to influence the target variable (SalePrice).

2. **Model Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train a linear regression model using the training set.
   - Use the trained model to predict housing prices on the testing set.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
   - Analyze the model's performance and identify any limitations.

4. **Analysis**:
   - Discuss the limitations of using linear regression for predicting housing prices.
   - Identify potential issues such as assumption of linearity, handling outliers, feature interactions, and overfitting/underfitting.
   - Propose potential improvements and suggest more advanced machine learning techniques that could be used to enhance the model's performance.

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience with linear regression and develop a deeper understanding of its limitations. This will prepare you for the more advanced machine learning techniques covered in the subsequent chapters of this book.

### Conclusion

This challenge problem serves as a practical exercise to reinforce the concepts discussed in this chapter. It also highlights the necessity for more sophisticated models and methods to address the limitations of traditional statistical approaches. As you progress through the chapters, you will explore advanced techniques that can improve the accuracy and robustness of your predictions, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of machine learning.

Feel free to dive into the dataset, follow the outlined steps, and critically analyze your findings. This hands-on experience will be invaluable as you continue your journey into the world of machine learning.

## 1.2 Motivating Problem

To illustrate the power and necessity of machine learning, letâ€™s consider a practical problem: predicting housing prices. This problem is relevant to real estate professionals and anyone interested in understanding how various factors influence property values.

Imagine you have a dataset containing information about houses that have been sold in a particular area. Each entry includes features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, age of the house, and the sale price. Your goal is to build a model that can predict the sale price of a house given its features.

At first glance, this might seem like a straightforward task for traditional statistical methods. One common approach is linear regression, which models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this case, the sale price is the dependent variable, and the features of the house are the independent variables.

Linear regression fits a line (or a hyperplane in higher dimensions) to the data points to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_n x_n + \epsilon $$

where $ y $ is the sale price, $ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n $ are the features of the house, $ \beta_0 $ is the intercept, $ \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n $ are the coefficients that represent the weight of each feature, and $ \epsilon $ is the error term.

This equation's simplicity allows for an interpretable model of how different features contribute to the sale price. For example, a positive coefficient for the number of bedrooms indicates that houses with more bedrooms tend to sell for higher prices.

### Limitations of Traditional Methods

Despite its elegance, linear regression has its limitations. One major limitation is the assumption of a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. In reality, the relationship between housing features and sale prices can be highly nonlinear. For instance, the effect of an additional bedroom on the sale price might diminish after a certain point, or the impact of location might interact with other features like square footage or age of the house.

Linear regression is also sensitive to outliers. A few extreme values can disproportionately influence the model, leading to skewed predictions. For example, a few exceptionally high-priced houses in a luxury neighborhood could distort the model, making it less accurate for predicting prices of average homes.

Moreover, linear regression can struggle with high-dimensional data, where the number of features is large relative to the number of observations. This situation can cause overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Overfitting occurs because the model captures noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern.

Manual feature engineering is another challenge. Identifying and creating meaningful features from raw data requires domain expertise and can be time-consuming. Traditional methods often rely on handcrafted features, which might not capture complex interactions between variables.

To illustrate these limitations, consider a dataset with ten different features for each house. Using linear regression, we might find that the model performs well on the training data but poorly on a separate test set. This discrepancy indicates that the model is overfitting the training data, capturing noise rather than the underlying trend.

To mitigate these issues, we can use more advanced techniques from machine learning. Decision trees, for instance, can capture nonlinear relationships by partitioning the data into subsets based on feature values. Ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting can improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple models. Neural networks, with their ability to model complex interactions and nonlinearities, can further enhance predictive power, especially with large datasets.

By leveraging these advanced techniques, we can build more robust models that generalize better to new data, providing more accurate and reliable predictions. In the next sections, we will delve into these machine learning techniques, exploring how they address the limitations of traditional methods and uncover deeper insights from data.

Given the book-overview and 01-introduction-outline, let's focus on section 1.1.  Can you help me create the content for section 1.1 as raw markdown?  This is going to be the start of the actual content of the book.    We want to make this content as readable as possible (so we might want to minimize the bullet points unless you think it's best to show an overview at the start of the chapter).  Another goal that I have it to make the book an audio book.  I want to have it available to to "immersion reading" and "whyispersync for voice", so bullet points and lists aren't ideal.  Also, there's no need to have language or a paragraph to state what the next section is going to be about.  Think about how the reader will experience, read, and take in the content, one section after another maybe even multiple sections per sitting.

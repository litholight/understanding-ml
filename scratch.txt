"There are two main types of problems that supervised learning can address: classification and regression."

"Supervised learning algorithms can range from simple linear regression and logistic regression to more complex models like decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem and the nature of the data."

Can you make these update section 1.3 by elaborating on or rephrasing or updating these two paragraphs?
The first paragraph makes me believe that usually Classification and Regression are the only two types of supervised learning that are encountered.
